### Version Numbering Guidelines

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New features, backward-compatible changes
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, small improvements

Examples:
- `1.0.0` ‚Üí `2.0.0`: Complete ranking system overhaul
- `1.5.0` ‚Üí `1.6.0`: New cosmetic shop feature
- `1.5.2` ‚Üí `1.5.3`: Token movement bug fix

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Handoff Protocol

### Context Preservation

When starting a new chat session, AI assistants should:

1. **Read Core Documentation**
   - Review PROJECT_SUMMARY.md for current state
   - Check CHANGELOG.md for recent changes
   - Understand DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md patterns

2. **Assess Current State**
   - Check git status and recent commits
   - Review package.json for dependencies
   - Understand current build status

3. **Identify Active Work**
   - Look for TODO comments in code
   - Check for incomplete features
   - Review any work-in-progress branches

### Information Gathering Checklist

Before making changes, gather information about:

- [ ] Current project architecture and patterns
- [ ] Recent changes and their impact
- [ ] Existing test coverage and requirements
- [ ] Performance considerations and constraints
- [ ] User experience and accessibility standards
- [ ] Deployment and build processes

### Change Documentation Requirements

For any significant changes:

- [ ] Update appropriate documentation files
- [ ] Add changelog entry with proper categorization
- [ ] Include migration notes for breaking changes

- [ ] Review impact on existing features

## üìä Quality Assurance

### Pre-Release Checklist

Before marking a version as released:

- [ ] All features documented in changelog
- [ ] Breaking changes clearly marked
- [ ] Migration instructions provided
- [ ] Code examples updated

- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] Documentation reviewed for accuracy

### Documentation Review Process

Monthly documentation review:

1. **Accuracy Check**
   - Verify all examples still work
   - Check for outdated information
   - Validate external links

2. **Completeness Review**
   - Ensure new features are documented
   - Check for missing patterns or guidelines
   - Verify changelog completeness

3. **Clarity Assessment**
   - Review for unclear explanations
   - Check for consistent terminology
   - Ensure examples are helpful

## üîß Automation Opportunities

### Potential Automations

1. **Changelog Generation**
   - Parse commit messages for changelog entries
   - Automatically categorize changes
   - Generate draft entries for review

2. **Documentation Validation**
   - Check for broken links
   - Validate code examples
   - Ensure consistent formatting

3. **Version Management**
   - Automatic version bumping
   - Tag creation and release notes
   - Documentation deployment

### Implementation Guidelines

When implementing automation:

- Maintain human review for quality
- Ensure automation doesn't replace thoughtful documentation
- Keep manual override capabilities
- Test automation thoroughly before deployment
